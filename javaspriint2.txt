===>Promise chaining is a way to perform a series of asynchronous operations in a sequential manner using JavaScript promises. 
It allows you to chain multiple asynchronous tasks together, where the result of one task becomes the input for the next task. This pattern helps avoid nested callback hell and makes the code more readable and maintainable.

In the context of promises, chaining is achieved by returning a new promise from the .
then() method, which allows you to attach another .then() handler to it. This creates a chain of promises, where the value resolved by the previous promise flows through the chain.

Here's an example of promise chaining:

Let's say we want to perform three asynchronous tasks: fetching user data, fetching user posts, and fetching user comments. Each of these tasks returns a promise.

javascript
==========
// Simulating asynchronous tasks with setTimeout
function fetchUserData() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve({ id: 1, name: 'John Doe' }), 1000);
  });
}

function fetchUserPosts(userId) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve({ userId, posts: ['Post 1', 'Post 2', 'Post 3'] }), 1500);
  });
}

function fetchUserComments(userId) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve({ userId, comments: ['Comment 1', 'Comment 2'] }), 2000);
  });
}

// Chaining promises
fetchUserData()
  .then((user) => {
    console.log('User:', user);
    return fetchUserPosts(user.id); // Return the promise to chain
  })
  .then((posts) => {
    console.log('Posts:', posts);
    return fetchUserComments(posts.userId); // Return the promise to chain
  })
  .then((comments) => {
    console.log('Comments:', comments);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });


In this example
==============
we have three asynchronous functions (fetchUserData, fetchUserPosts, and fetchUserComments), each returning a promise that resolves with the relevant data. 
We use promise chaining to fetch the user data, then the user's posts, and finally the user's comments in sequence.

The .then() method is used to handle the resolved values of the promises returned by each function. We return the promises from the .
then() handlers to chain them together. 
If any promise in the chain is rejected (throws an error), the control jumps to the nearest .
catch() block to handle the error.

With promise chaining, the code remains more readable and structured, and you can easily extend the chain to include more asynchronous tasks without descending into nested callbacks.
