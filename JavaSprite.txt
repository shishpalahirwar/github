=>>The given code snippet contains a loop that iterates from 0 to 4 (i.e., five iterations) using the variable i. Within each iteration, there is a setTimeout function that schedules the execution of an arrow function after a delay of 100 milliseconds. The arrow function then logs the value of the variable i to the console.

Now, let's understand the output and the reason behind it:

Output:
======
5
5
5
5
5
Explanation:
===========

When the setTimeout function is used within the loop, it schedules the execution of the arrow function asynchronously.
The loop runs through all iterations quickly, and by the time the arrow functions are executed after the specified delay, the value of i is already equal to 5 because the loop has completed.

In JavaScript, closures capture references to variables, not the variable values themselves.
So, all the arrow functions scheduled in the loop share the same reference to the variable i. 
When these arrow functions are executed, they access the shared reference to i, and at that moment, the value of i is 5 (the loop termination condition). 
Hence, each arrow function logs the value of i, which is 5.

To achieve the desired behavior of logging values from 0 to 4, you can create a separate closure for each iteration by using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):

javascript
==========
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  (function (num) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(num), 100);
  })(i);
}
This way, each iteration creates its own closure with its specific value of i, 
and when the arrow functions are executed, they log the correct values 0 to 4 respectively.
